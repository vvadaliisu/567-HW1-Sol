{\bf Problem 4. \em Not Possible} \\ 
    \underline{Proof : } \\ \\
    {\em Invariant :}  The difference between any two pairs only changes in multiples of 3. \\ \\
    lets say k = m + 1 and m = n + 1. \\
    \tab Lets consider the difference between Green and Black Chameleons, initially, m - n = 1. \\
    1 Black and 1 Green become 2 Brown ${\implies (m - 1) - (n - 1) = 1 + 3 (0)}$\\ \\
    1 Black and 1 Brown become 2 Green ${\implies (m + 2) - (n - 1) = 4 = 1 + 3 (1)}$ \\ \\
    1 Green and 1 Brown become 2 Black ${\implies (m - 1) - (n + 2) = -2 = 1 + 3 (-1)}$ \\ \\
    But our final state requires that Black and Green be zero, which is equal. Hence it is not always possible to achieve a single color.\\

{\bf Problem 5.} \\ 
    \em \underline {Proof By Contradiction :} \\  \tab \tab Consider any Graph G with vertices {1, 2, .... n}. If no two vertices have same degree, then each of these vertices must have degrees {0, 1 .... n - 1}. But you cannot have two vertices with 0 and n - 1 degree together. Hence our assumption that no two vertices have same degree is incorrect.
